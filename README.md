# SLAM+ris

SLAM+ris is a Tetris variant for the SLAM+128 ULA replacement. It is compatible with the **ZX Spectrum 128k** (a.k.a. "Toastrack") and the gray **ZX Spectrum +2** with their ULA replaced with SLAM+128, as well as with the **ZX UNO** and its derivatives.

The game requires the ***ULAplus** palette*, the *Timex Multicolor mode*, and *Turbo Sound*, the 6-channel PSG.
